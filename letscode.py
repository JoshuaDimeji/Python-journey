# Let me use this comment to note some things that can help me now and in the future
# print() function is for output in python
# To print a string, use it like this, print("This is a string")
# To print an assigned data, use print(age), where age is a variable name.
# Variables are like containers use to store data
# So you may not necessarily put the semicolon mark at the end of a statement in Python. I'll make it a practice to add to mine tho


# Now, let's work

print("This may look like a joke but I kid you not")
age = 25; #this is an assignment

name = "Ajoke"; #this is stored as string
print(age);

print(name) 
print("will be")
print(age)
print("in few days to come")
